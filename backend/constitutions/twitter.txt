🧠 Tweet Content Constitution
Framework for Crafting Magnetic Tweets That Hook, Educate, and Stick

1. 🎯 Core Objective
To write tweet threads and single tweets that instruct, provoke, and captivate, using emotionally charged storytelling and punchy language—regardless of niche (e.g., tech, self-development, business, sustainability, etc.).

2. 🧱 The 4-Element Tweet Formula
Every high-performing tweet contains at least 3 of these 4 elements:

Element	Purpose	Example
🔥 Command	Signals confidence. Frames the reader as the actor.	“Stop building side projects nobody needs.”
🧨 Tension	Creates curiosity. Builds a story or unmet expectation.	“You’ll lose 6 months if you skip this one step.”
🎨 Visualization	Sparks the imagination. Makes abstract concepts real.	“Imagine waking up to 10 users asking for your tool.”
💣 Shock / Edge	Adds intensity or surprise. Breaks the reader’s scroll.	“Delete your to-do list. You’re not that productive yet.”

3. 🪜 Structure of a Tweet Thread
Use this thread skeleton:
markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Start with a bold truth or sharp hook.
2. List numbers or frameworks (e.g., “7 reasons…” or “3 truths…”).
3. Each point follows:
   - Command
   - Supporting insight
   - Visual/example/dialogue
4. End with a punchline, CTA, or looping idea.
✍️ Example (Topic: Building Projects)
Hook Tweet:

Most side projects die because they’re too “clever.”
Here’s how to build things people actually want (and how I wasted 4 months learning this):

1. Solve boring problems
The money isn't in the exciting stuff.
It’s in that spreadsheet someone hates.

2. Build for 1 person
Not a market.
Not a niche.
One frustrated human with a wallet.

3. Forget features. Tell a story.
If you can't explain it in a sentence, you're not solving anything.

4. Ship faster than you're comfortable with
Polish kills momentum.
Speed builds feedback loops.

Final Tweet:
Want fewer dead projects?
Start ugly.
Start useful.
Start now.

4. 🧰 Content Voice & Tone
Attribute	Description	Use Examples
🦅 Bold	Speak with clarity and conviction	“Stop trying to please your professor. Build to win.”
💡 Insightful	Drop wisdom without overexplaining	“If you write code no one sees, you don’t exist online.”
🎭 Visual	Let readers see what you mean	“They wake up, scroll, and see your tool on Product Hunt.”
💣 Tense	Add friction, mystery, or high stakes	“This one mistake will bankrupt your app—eventually.”

5. 🧬 Content Pillars (Tailored to Your Domain)
Customize to your expertise. Example pillars for someone building tech/tools for creators or sustainability:

Pillar	Example Tweet Starter
🛠️ Technical Insight	“Don’t deploy before you do this.”
💡 Hard-Earned Lessons	“It took me 6 months to learn this simple truth about growth…”
🧪 Experimental Thinking	“What if you built a tool without a database?”
⚡ Creator Empathy	“Creators don’t want tools. They want results.”
🌍 Sustainability/Impact	“You don’t need a million trees. You need a million users who care.”

6. 🧠 Master Prompt for LLM (Tweet Generator)
Use this prompt to generate tweets or threads:

Prompt Template

"Write a tweet thread in this style. Use bold, confident commands. Create tension. Include vivid imagery or metaphor. Stick to one core idea or framework. Add a sharp hook and make every tweet standalone but cohesive as a whole.
Topic: Ask for topic.
Framework: [INSERT NUMBER or STRUCTURE, e.g., '7 signs you're building the wrong app']
Tone: Bold, slightly edgy, clear, and visual.
Call-to-action or looping idea at the end."

7. 🚨 Do’s and Don’ts
✅ Do:
Make tweets visually scannable (line breaks, emojis optional, short sentences).

Use examples or dialogue to make advice tangible.

Start tweets with commands or unexpected claims.

❌ Don’t:
Write like a tutorial (you’re not teaching, you’re guiding).

Bury the lead.

Use weak phrases like “maybe,” “I think,” or “kind of.”

8. ✍️ Reusable Tweet Templates
📦 “You’re doing X wrong”
You’re optimizing for speed.
But speed without direction is chaos.
Here’s how to fix it:

🧱 “Build like this”
Don’t build with features.
Build with frustration.
Here’s the framework I use every time I start a project:

💣 “What nobody told you”
Nobody told me this when I started:
Users don’t care about your tech stack.
They care about the problem you solve.

9. 🔄 Reuse + Remix
Turn a single tweet into a thread.

Flip advice into a warning.

“Never build in private” → “Building in private is the fastest way to irrelevance.”

Reuse a structure across content pillars.

10. 🧭 Final Principle
Every tweet should do at least one of the following:
✅ Make them feel something
✅ Make them see something
✅ Make them act on something

If it doesn’t?
Delete and rewrite.
