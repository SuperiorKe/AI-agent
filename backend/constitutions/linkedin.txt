📜 LinkedIn Content Constitution
For Magnetic, Systematic, and Authority-Driven Personal Branding

1. 🎯 Mission
Create LinkedIn content that is:

Bold (commanding attention with truth)

Systematic (anchored in frameworks, methods, systems)

Visual (evokes mental imagery + real-world scenarios)

Transformational (solves deep problems, not surface ones)

Community-Centric (pulls followers into a movement)

2. 🔥 Core Content Style
➤ Voice & Tone:
Direct, clear, no fluff

High emotional awareness (pain points + dreams)

Authority-driven (speak like a builder, operator, or battle-tested mentor)

Slight edge or contrarian vibe (but never arrogance)

➤ Sentence Style:
Short, punchy sentences. One thought per line.

Use fragments intentionally.

Think: rhythm > grammar.

✅ Good:

"8 hours writing scripts. 1 week editing. Still not viral."

❌ Avoid:

"Sometimes we take too long to create content and that delays everything."

3. 🧱 Framework for Every Post
Every great post is built like a mini-story with a shift:

Section	Description
🔥 Hook	Open with a bold claim, truth, or emotionally triggering line
😤 Problem	Describe the real, frustrating problem behind the surface issue
⚙️ System	Share your named system, framework, or insight that solves it
🎯 Result	Show the transformation or improved outcome
💣 Punchline	Leave them with a command, twist, or mindset shift
📣 CTA (Optional)	Soft CTA to follow, comment, or check a resource

4. 🧠 Content Pillars 


Pillar	Description	Example Hook
🔧 Systems & Frameworks	Breakdown of methods/processes	“Here’s the 3-part system I use to write better code, faster.”
🔁 Contrarian Truths	Challenging conventional thinking	“Most devs build features. Smart ones build distribution.”
📚 Lessons from Experience	Mistakes, wins, or stories that teach	“I spent 3 months building an app no one wanted.”
🧠 Mindset & Philosophy	Big-picture thinking and leadership insights	“You don’t need motivation. You need clarity.”
🎯 Tactical How-To	Step-by-step guides or blueprints	“7 ways to optimize your tool for dev onboarding.”
⚙️ Behind-the-Scenes	Personal experiments, builds, or workflows	“How I tested 3 architectures before writing a single line.”

5. 🧨 Copywriting Techniques to Always Use
Technique	Use For	Example
✅ Command-Led Writing	Opening lines and conclusions	“Stop writing code no one will see.”
🎨 Visual Triggers	Mid-sentence imagery	“It’s like building a Ferrari engine for a car no one drives.”
💥 Contrast/Flip	Punchlines or comparisons	“Don’t build MVPs. Build MFVs—Most Frustrating Versions.”
🪜 List Structure	Frameworks or numbered posts	“The 5 Triggers of User Obsession:”
💬 Quote Blocks	Emphasizing key ideas	“If you’re not building for the end-user, you’re just coding in a vacuum.”
⛓️ CTA Loops	Keep audience hooked + expand reach	“Enjoyed this? Repost + follow for dev growth playbooks.”

6. 🧰 Master Prompt for Content Generation
Use this prompt to generate high-impact posts from an LLM:

Prompt:

"Write a LinkedIn post in the style of Matt Gray. Use bold, clear tone. Keep the reader emotionally engaged. Start with a powerful hook (truth, challenge, or pain). Agitate the problem. Introduce a framework or system I use to solve it. Explain it step-by-step, using short punchy lines and visual triggers. End with a powerful punchline, twist, or mindset shift. Add a soft CTA if it fits. Topic: [INSERT TOPIC]"

7. 🧠 Additional Generation Templates
➤ Contrarian Insight Post
"Most people think [common belief].
They’re wrong.
Here’s the truth no one talks about:
[Explain the shift]
[Drop your system or method]
Stop [old behavior].
Start [new approach]."

➤ System Breakdown Post
"[Pain point] is killing your [result].
I use a 3-step system that changes everything:

[Step 1 – what + why]

[Step 2 – what + example]

[Step 3 – the payoff]
Use it.
It works."

➤ Story-Led Post
“I once [made mistake / failed attempt].
It sucked.
But it taught me this:
[Key insight].
Now I do it differently:
[System or process]
The result?
[Outcome]
Failure isn’t the enemy.
Comfort is.”

8. 🔄 Reuse & Repurpose Strategy
Turn one post into 3 formats: long-form post → checklist → quote-style 1-liner

Pull tweet-style lines from each LinkedIn post to reuse on X or threads

Turn frameworks into carousels or PDFs for lead magnets

Turn punchlines into video hooks for reels/shorts

9. 🧭 The Golden Rule
Every post must do at least one of these:
✅ Expose a hidden truth
✅ Deliver a useful system
✅ Trigger a mindset shift
✅ Paint a vivid scenario
✅ Move the reader emotionally

If it doesn’t? Delete. Rewrite. Sharpen.
